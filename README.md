#Stream Editing
This is part of my Vim practice collection

With script.sh, you can edit file you want in this way:
1. The file and script.sh have to be in the same folder. 
1. Select the name of the test you want to edit: e.g. placeholder
2. Pick the word you want to edit that with: e.g. my_website_name

Then, after you give the script.sh permissions via chmod, you run it as follows:
```
./script.sh placeholder my_website_name filename 
```
